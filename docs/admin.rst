MIcKA technology enables entry, editing, harvesting, discovery, and view of metadata. It provides tools for compilation and export of the metadata in standardized formats. 

The code of MIcKA version 6 is available as Open Source and it is available for downloading and instalation (https://github.com/hsrs-cz/Micka). 

The EGDI Metadata Catalogue is a customized version of the MIcKA catalogue.
